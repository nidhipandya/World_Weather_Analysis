# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project
PlanMyTrip is looking to take their app to the next level. They would like to add the weather description to the data we collected for them. We will create input statements for Beta testers to filter the data with their weather preferences to identify travel destinations and nearby hotels. From this new list of data the Beta testers will select four cities to create a travel itinerary that will use the Google Maps Directions API to provid them with a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
### Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data

### Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Here min. temp = 75 f and max. temp = 90 f

### Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
Here cities are start_end = "Saint-Denis", stop1 = "Mantua", stop2 = "Hyeres", stop3 = "Calafell"
